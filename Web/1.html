<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Main idea</h3>

<p>
Being inspired by R Murray Schafer and his Soundscape theory we decided to think wider and apply it for <strong>the scale of the city.</strong>
We provide an opportunity for the audience to experiment with a map
 (locate some places on the map of Dieburg) and to <strong>create a <u>sound composition</u> of the city </strong>together.
The following step will be to ask them to associate these places with colors.
<br>Our goal is to experience sounds environment and compose the city Dieburg.
