      The aim of our Workshop is to get in touch with people and rebuild a “map” of the city of Dieburg through the creative means and potential of digital media, so as a result of that will be form of compositions and color boxes created by the participants through the association of soundscaping and colors.
      The impressionistic feedback sculpture we will call
