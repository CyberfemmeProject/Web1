      Since the start of the IMC, students are lucky to have an opportunity to build connections with people in Dieburg throughout the workshop. <br>
      By continuing this tradition, we aim to deepen the meaning of importance towards certain people or things that the citizens and visitors of Dieburg treasure,
      strengthening the connection with everyone involved in the town, including people from the IMC.
