      Since the start of the IMC, students are lucky to have an opportunity to build connections with people in Dieburg throughout the workshop. <br>
      By continuing this tradition, we aim to deepen the meaning of importance towards certain people or things that the citizens and visitors of Dieburg treasure,
      strengthening the connection with everyone involved in the town, including people from the IMC.

      <h3>Main idea</h3>

      <p>
      Being inspired by R Murray Schafer and his Soundscape theory we decided to think wider and apply it for <strong>the scale of the city.</strong>
      We provide an opportunity for the audience to experiment with a map
       (locate some places on the map of Dieburg) and to <strong>create a <u>sound composition</u> of the city </strong>together.
      The following step will be to ask them to associate these places with colors.
      <br>Our goal is to experience sounds environment and compose the city Dieburg.
